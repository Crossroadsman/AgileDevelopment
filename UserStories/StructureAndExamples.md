| 172: Add Item to Basket             |
|-------------------------------------|
| **AS A** customer                   |
| **I WANT** to add items to a basket |
| **SO THAT** I can review them later |
|                                     |
| Priority: 8                         |
| Points: 5                           |


Key:

172                - unique ID for the story  
Add Item to Basket - title for the story  
**AS A**           - phrase to define the user whose needs this story serves  
**I WANT**         - phrase to describe the action to be taken or goal to be accomplished  
**SO THAT**        - phrase to describe the value to the user that results from completing the action  
Priority           - the priority estimate for the story  
Points             - the estimated amount of work (in points) for the story  

The **SO THAT** phrase drives the acceptance criteria.

One way to derive acceptance criteria from the story is to rework each phrase element, substituting:

- a **GIVEN** phrase for the **AS A** phrase
- a **WHEN** phrase for the **I WANT** phrase
- a **THEN** phrase for the **SO THAT** phrase
