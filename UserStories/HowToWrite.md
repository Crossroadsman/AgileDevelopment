How to Write Good User Stories
==============================

Tip 1: There is no story without a goal. Start by outlining the goals of users in the system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User stories describe functionality in **terms of outcomes** (goals of the user).

Tip 2: Include metadata or other artifacts with the user story.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Tip 3: Make sure you have a set of cards with the different user personas.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Understand *who* the users are, *what* their pain points are, *how* we can address those pain points.

Tip 4: Involve the customer in writing the stories.
---------------------------------------------------

Tip 5: Keep the stories short: they are just reminders to have the conversation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User stories have three parts (CCC mnemonic):

- the user story itself (the *card*);
- the *conversation*;
- the acceptance criteria (the *conversation*).

The conversation is the most important part.

The conversation includes:

- with customers/stakeholders (to outline wants/needs);
- with team to articulate the need (the essence of successful project leadership is to *clearly communicate a vision*, in both big and small senses)
