User Story Prioritisation
=========================

- Option 1: Prioritise by knowledge value
- Option 2: Prioritise by expected profit impact (increase in revenue/decrease in costs)
- Option 3: Prioritise by project risk


The MoSCoW Model
----------------

A model for prioritising user stories:

- **M**: Must Have (critical for success)
  - Essential: key stakeholders' needs will not be met if this requirement is not delivered, and the timebox will be considered failed.
- **S**: Should Have (do if not time critical)
  - Important: but if not delivered in this timebox, an acceptable workaround exists until delivered in the next sprint.
- **C**: Could Have (include if little development cost)
  - Nice to have: estimated as possible in the timebox but can be de-scoped if underestimate has occurred.
- **W**: Won't Do (but would like) (maybe do in the future)
  - Will not be delivered within the timebox
