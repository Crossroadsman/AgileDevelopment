How To Estimate Amount of Work in User Stories
==============================================

Option 1: Ideal days
--------------------

- This is the most common measure in traditional project management;
- Assumption is 'how long would it take if I had nothing else to work on';
- Used in conjunction with an efficency coefficient to get from ideal days to realistic days;
- *Any measure of calendar time, **regardless of caveats supplied**, will be interpreted as a commitment*.


Option 2: Story Points
----------------------

- Used to decouple estimation of size and effort from duration of time;
- Instead of estimating time, estimate size and let velocity data tell you how long it will take;
- If you don't have velocity data, start with best guess for how much work can be done in a sprint, then compare to actual once actual data is available.

Rule of Thumb: 1, 2, 3
----------------------

- 1 user story should typically take
- 2 person team
- 3 days or less

Estimating the Project
----------------------

The to-do list on an agile project is called the *master story list*. It contains all the user stories, which represent all the features the customer values in the project.

The rate at which we convert user stories into working software is called the *velocity* (in points per iteration). This measure is used for determining the team's productivity and estimating dates of completion.

To estimate delivery dates, take the total estimated effort (in points) of the project, divide by estimated velocity, and that gives us a guide to how many iterations the project will take.
