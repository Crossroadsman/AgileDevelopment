Running A User Story Workshop
=============================

High-level User Story Process
-----------------------------
1. Establish product vision statement;
2. Identify user roles/personas;
3. User stories (CCC);
4. Story Map;
5. Determine Sprint.


1: Before the Event
-------------------

- Ensure the overall objectives of the project or change are clear; understand what will change and why (vision).
- It is ok if the vision is vague at first, perhaps described in marketing terms rather than system terms. It will become clearer as the project progresses.
- Know your stakeholders. They will have differing needs and requirements, and some may not understand how changes will impact them.
  Remember: suppliers, developers, and product/process owners are stakeholders.
- Ensure the participants for the workshop cover all stakeholder groups.
- Consider whether a customer proxy is needed.
- Appoint product owner.
- Prepare a brief overview of what user stories are.
- Prepare examples (ideally covering entire lifecycle from initial workshop, through refinements, through to implementation).

2: During the Event
-------------------

### User Story Workshop: Typical Agenda ###

#### Introduction and Setup ####

- Brief introduction
  - Aims and objectives for the day

- Explanation: What is a User Story
  - Explain the importance of user stories
  - What a user story does not do
  - Demonstrate how to write a user story
  - Explain the role that the stories will play in the development process
  
- Explanation: The Structure of a User Story
  - Description and example (who, what, why)
  - Optional information
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Clarity: the benefits of keeping it simple
  - Epic: explain what it is and give example of splitting an epic into stories

- Explanation: Organisation of User Story
  - Explain how backlogs work

#### Story Writing ####

- Persona Writing
  - Brainstorming initial set of user personas
  - Organize set of user personas
  - Consolidate the set of user personas
  - Refine the set of user personas
  - The above steps will yield a refined set of user personas

- Story Writing
  - Use index cards or stickies
  - Choose a user persona to work through
  - Write as many cards as possible for the persona
  - After everyone has written their stories, have the participants group the stories (into themes and epics)
  - Use story mapping

#### Review ####

- Review and Confirmation of Understanding
  - say the stories out loud
  - retain only the stories needed
  - sometimes new stories will emerge and others may be discarded
  - Have conversation about each story
  - Generate reliable set of acceptance criteria (confirmations) for the stories
  - Prioritize for iteration

- Prioritisation of User Stories: Generating the Release Plan
  - Use MoSCoW prioritisation to identify 'must have' user stories from the backlog
  - If a story is considered mandatory, assess its contribution to the project objectives. Some stories may lose mandatory status and be 
  recategorised as 'should have'.
  
#### Wrap-up #####

- Wrap-up
  - Explain how these workshops are important, but the project only really takes shape after a few of the first stories have been 
  developed.
  - Outline next steps.

3: After the Event
------------------

- Story priorities should be revisited frequently. Where time and/or costs are fixed, low priority stories may fall out of scope.
- Product owners, customer proxies or similar representatives for each identified user role need to be available to have detailed 
conversations with developers to clarify specific stories where required.
