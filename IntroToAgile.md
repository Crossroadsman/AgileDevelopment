Introduction to Agile
=====================

Why Agile?
----------

Agile approaches represent an alternative to traditional software development. These approaches promise faster delivery of software 
projects that better achieve customer needs and are responsive to evolving requirements throughout the process.


What is Agile?
--------------

Agile is an umbrella term for a range of software development methodologies that focus on short, rapid iterations of development.

Traditional software development practices, now described as 'waterfall' methodologies had the following approximate sequential process:

- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Verification
- Maintenance

The sequential nature of waterfall has some major disadvantages:

- It assumes everything is knowable in advance;
- The requirements are mandatory, fixed, hard to change;
- Expensive;
- Slows down development;
- Easy to verify, hard to validate;
- Treats learnings during development as "scope changes".

Additionally, the traditional 'requirements' approach for determining project scope has disadvantages, such as:

- The development is feature-centric rather than value-centric;
- Specifies the what, not the why;
- Critical elements are hidden in the detail.

Agile approaches evolved to address these shortcomings and to recognise the fundamental reality that requirements change and evolve over 
the course of the project life.
