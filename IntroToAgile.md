Introduction to Agile
=====================

Why Agile?
----------

Agile approaches represent an alternative to traditional software development. These approaches promise faster delivery of software 
projects that better achieve customer needs and are responsive to evolving requirements throughout the process.


What is Agile?
--------------

Agile is an umbrella term for a range of software development methodologies that focus on short, rapid iterations of development.

Traditional software development practices, now described as 'waterfall' methodologies had the following approximate sequential process:

- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Verification
- Maintenance

The sequential nature of waterfall has some major disadvantages:

- It assumes everything is knowable in advance;
- The requirements are mandatory, fixed, hard to change;
- Expensive;
- Slows down development;
- Easy to verify, hard to validate;
- Treats learnings during development as "scope changes".

Additionally, the traditional 'requirements' approach for determining project scope has disadvantages, such as:

- The development is feature-centric rather than value-centric;
- Specifies the what, not the why;
- Critical elements are hidden in the detail.

Agile approaches evolved to address these shortcomings and to recognise the fundamental reality that requirements change and evolve over 
the course of the project life.

In 2001, seventeen prominent representives of a variety of nascent alternative development methodologies met to try to find common ground. 
The result of this meeting was the [*Agile Manifesto*][AM01] and [*The Twelve Principles*][AM02].

### The Agile Manifesto ###

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.  
Working software over comprehensive documentation.  
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.  
Responding to change over following a plan.

### The 12 Principles ###

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

### Agile Processes ###

Most agile projects begin with identifying a project *vision*, determining *user personas*, *user stories*, and proceed with a cycle of short development interations which address the features that are most valued by the customer.

User stories can change during the development process so that the development work is responsive to an evolving understanding of user (and customer) needs.

Determining user stories is a repeating cycle where business and development representatives create stories reflecting individual user needs, written from the perspective of the user and emphasising the value that the user expects to get from completing the described action. These stories form the basis for a group conversation to flesh out an understanding of these needs and to document *acceptance criteria*, which describe a testable set of conditions that determine whether the described need has been met.
